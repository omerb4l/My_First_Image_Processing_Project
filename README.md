#Face Detection with OpenCV
This is a Python project that uses the OpenCV library to perform face detection. The program detects faces in real-time from a video feed and highlights them with bounding boxes.

#Features
Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
Simple and intuitive interface.
Adjustable detection parameters for better accuracy.

#Requirements
Python
OpenCV 

#Install the dependencies using pip:
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless

#File Descriptions
opencv.py: Main script for face detection.
haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: Haar cascade file for frontal face detection.

#Future Improvements
Person based face detection(FaceID).
Implement DNN-based face detection for improved accuracy.
